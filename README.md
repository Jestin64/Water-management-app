# Water-management-app
This is a simple dashboard crud operations app, implemented in under 3 hours, mainly focused on showcasing design principles, folder stucture and basic crud operations

# Backend:
    Navigate to server folder and run
    ### yarn install && yarn dev

port 4000 should be running the server

note: I didnt use any db for this assignment since i felt it wasnt necessary, so instead have implemented a json document file as a pseudo mongodb style persistent storage

# Front end: 
    Navigate to client folder and run
    ### yarn install && yarn start

port 3000 the client server will be run
